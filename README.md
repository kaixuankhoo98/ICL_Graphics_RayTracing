# ICL_Graphics_RayTracing
This repository contains json files that can be uploaded to https://shaderlabweb.doc.ic.ac.uk/ to see the result of my work.

In this repository, I implement the creation of sphere objects, and implementing a ray tracing algorithm from scratch. The source code is also provided.

## Ray tracing
A simple ray tracing algorithm from scratch to generate the following image of spheres above a checkerboard.

## Extension
In this extension, I implemented a purple fog, as well as a rainbow color scheme and smooth shadowing.
